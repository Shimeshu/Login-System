README OF THE PROJECT


ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is a basic pythonic implementation of a Login System where the user
has to either Login or Register.

The System.py file is the main file from where the whole system will run.

The User Details will be saved in the Current Working Directory of the User in the "Registered Users"
folder.
